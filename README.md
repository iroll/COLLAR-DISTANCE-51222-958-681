COLLAR, DISTANCE - 51222-958-681

This is the "distance collar" that helps locate the two fork guides in the front fork of these Honda ATCs:

Honda ATV 1982 ATC200E A FRONT FORK<br>
Honda ATV 1983 ATC200E A - BIG RED Front Fork / Front Damper<br>
Honda ATV 1984 ATC200ES A - BIG RED Front Shock Absorber

I designed this for my 1984 ATC200ES after I had to cut the old ones out because the inside of the fork tube looked like chernobyl after a mudslide.<br><br>
I printed it on a FlashForge Adventurer 3 Lite using AmazonBasics PLA, 210C extruder, 50C platform, and the tolerances were just right so that it fit snugly but could be pushed/pulled in/out, which I did several times with just my fingers.<br><br>
Protips: 1) print 3 of them so that you can use one to hammer in the others, since the fork guides fit more snugly than the collar and 2) if you take the time to rebuild your forks, and literally every ATC200ES needs this unless it has been garage kept by a mature owner for 40 years (and most of them have been ramped off cliffs by teenagers at this point), anyways if you take the time to rebuild your forks I would suggest aggressively derusting everything and giving everything a liberal coating of automotive grease before you seal it all up again. The grease will make it easier to seat (and future remove) the parts and will keep them from fusing to the inside of the tube with rust like your old ones probably did.
